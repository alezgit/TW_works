Professor let me know if you can open the files.
I can run them in VSCODE (by clicking right button on the HTML file)
Maybe it's necessary to open them in the same folder.

Of course, as we saw in class, I won't upload the file with the https certificate and the node stuff since it won't work for you

I followed the directions of the Group of the lesson and dowloaded openssl, started the node in the same way as them.


Please let me know if you run into some problems,
