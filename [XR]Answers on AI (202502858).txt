Create a carousel of 3D object I can visualize in augmented reality:
    - I would like a nice selection, with 3D previews to understand clear the object
    - The object will follow the theme of the personal page:
        - Curiosity
        - Food
        - Music
    - All of this should work with the Apple Quick Look and should create no problem with Safari


1) This was definitely the hardest task to complete. I struggled significantly with iPhone compatibility and ran into many problems trying to fix it. 
I tried using Firefox and other tools, but the WebXR examples simply wouldn't work. It wasn't until I searched for solutions on YouTube that 
I understood the core issue: Apple has a closed ecosystem. Unlike Android, which handles standard AR easily, 
iOS requires Apple's native Quick Look technology and specific .usdz file formats to display 3D models in the real world.

2) While the AI helped set up the basic 3D viewer logic quickly, it actually hindered the mobile implementation. It kept confidently 
suggesting standard WebXR code that is incompatible with iPhones, failing to mention Apple's proprietary ecosystem. 
I wasted hours debugging its 'technically correct' code before manual research revealed I needed to totally switch to
Apple's native Quick Look and .usdz files.

3) As a management engineer, I see AR as a useful instrument.
I imagine moving beyond 2D dashboards to overlaying real-time predictive analytics directly onto a client's supply chain or machinery.
AR would allow me to visualize complex 'Digital Twins' on-site, enabling immediate, data-driven management decisions right there.
