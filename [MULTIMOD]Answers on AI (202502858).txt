Create a browser game controlled by the phone's accelerometer in this way:
 - It should give a simple interface to the user in order to connect the phone flawlessly
 - It should only capture the tilt on the y axis in order to be more easy to control
 - It should be a game in which the user will be impersonated by a ball and need to dodge some obstacles (rectangles) - flappy bird like
 - It should become more difficult the more the game is running, increasing the speed and tightening the space in which the ball can pass through
 - It's palette should be the same as the site, this gradient blend reminding of As Roma colours



1) In the first place it had some problems in understanding my request about the use of the telephone. It was difficult to use
so I switched (as I did in my non-AI version) to controlling only with the y axis. Surprisingly it managed the connection very well, thinking
about the QR code for the phone without the need of pasting the url on the phone. Then it had some problems in understanding 
the game mechanics and especially in computing the height of the obstacles.

2) The multimodality plays an importantt role: the mouse in this case would not give the same feeling of "driving" something with your handshakes
like a wheel. It also helps in tuning better the power and the speed of the turn, feels more natural to us. It allows also continuous complex movement,
which are pretty difficult to do on a keyboard.

3) Since the biggest technical challenge for me were the connection with the phone (I ran into some problems and had to go through more 
robust ways) and with the so called "game loop" understanding (how to make ball fall from the sky, the game over ecc). With AI, surprisingly the problems
were not about the link, neither about the game structure: it was about the regulation of the phone accelerometer and about the gameplay difficulty, the 
way of how to make the game an actual game.
